        <h1>Some words from the creator: </h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Siyuan. I created this website and all the videos in it. I want to tell you that I have never posted
            these videos on anywhere else. They are only on this website. The animation engine that I used is called Manim. 
            It is developped by 3Blue1Brown. It is used to animate math contents, but I found that it can also be used to 
            animate graphs in economics. I feel that this is revolutionary as you can actually see how the graphs
            move and how curves shift by the animations. You can always come back to this website if you have forgotten how to draw a diagram.
            I have added explanations, but they are fast and not detailed. I assume you have already studied the graph and you are coming here for revision.
            There are three tabs on top that you can click on. I have sorted diagrams by topics so you can find them easily.
            In the end, hope you enjoy them!
